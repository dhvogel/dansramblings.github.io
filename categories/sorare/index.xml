      <description>I bought Shane O’Neill because I think he will start at center back for Toronto and play every minute of every game this upcoming season. Toronto is a team on their way up and their defense will steadily improve for the next couple of years.
The Past Shane’s involvement (or lack thereof) with the Sounders always confused me. This last season, he was mostly a “closer”. Schmeltzer would sub him in at around the 60 minute mark in games where Seattle was ahead and he would go in there and make hard tackles until the final whistle.</description>

      <description>Nashville SC - Nashville has the best center back in the league in Zimmerman and the 2nd best playmaker in Mukhtar. As of now, there are gaps in the Nashville lineup… McCarty is getting older, Zimmerman’s cohorts in the back 3 could be stronger (looking at you, Miller), and Sapong is a good not great CF. But Nashville has $1M to work with from selling Johnston to Montreal, saved another $1M (and a DP spot) by letting go of Cadiz, and has DP Ake Loba waiting in the wings to fill in at CF.</description>
