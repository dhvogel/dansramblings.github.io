### Why I applied

I’m in my fourth year of being a SWE at Google. It’s a great job. I’ve learned a ton and I’ve met interesting people. But the work feels like work. I’m not particularly passionate about writing software for anonymous enterprises and I now see the job as a means to an end. I see myself doing the minimum to get a passable performance rating and that’s a sign that I need to move on.

I feel fairly lonely at work. My job is pretty much me sitting in front of my computer for 6 hours a day writing code, with the rare meeting thrown in there somewhere. Being single without kids or a home means that I’m just listening to a lot of lunchtime conversations. I’d like to find something more exciting, where I can meet new people, make meaningful connections, and feel like I’m learning again.

When I visited home about a year ago, I told my Dad that I was feeling like I hit a plateau. I heard him say that he had felt similarly at a certain point, and when he did that he went to business school to broaden his perspective. To me, that sounded like a reasonable next step.

I’m a goal-oriented person, and even having the goal of getting into the best business schools was exciting to me. I felt like I could justify hanging out on the career plateau if I was working hard on the next step.

Looking back, I’m glad that I decided to go through the application process.
