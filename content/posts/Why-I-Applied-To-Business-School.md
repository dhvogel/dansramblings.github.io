### Why I applied

I’m in my fourth year of software engineering at Google. It’s a great job. I’ve learned a ton and I’ve met interesting people. But I've increasingly started to
see the job as a means to an end, as opposed to something I really enjoy doing.

The community that I feel comes from outside of work. The group thread for my improv class is pretty vibrant and we do fun things together. I'm grateful for them. That's what feels good to me -- feeling connected, and feeling like I'm part of something bigger than myself. I want to feel that in what I do from nine-to-five as well.

When I visited home about a year ago, I told my Dad that I was feeling like I hit a plateau. He told me that when he felt that way, he went to business school. That sounded like a reasonable next step.

I’m a goal-oriented person, and even having the goal of getting into the best business school was exciting to me. I had my own little secret -- I was working on something bigger. I liked the challenge of the application process and how it forced me to think about what I wanted out of my career, and out of my life.

I'm glad I went through it, especially because it wasn't easy.
