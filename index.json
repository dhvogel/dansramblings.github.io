Looking at my quarantine-stricken calendar, I figured “what the fuck, might as well try it too”. Internally, this represented a leap of faith for me as a prior version of myself would ridicule “theater kids”, “band kids”, “art kids”, or any other kind of kid brave enough to express themself in front of others. Long story short, I ended up loving it and hope to continue doing improv comedy for the foreseeable future. Here’s why.\nImprov taught me life skills Improv taught me to be flexible. Sometimes I find myself preparing what to say before I even enter a conversation, anticipating what the other person might say back to me, and what I might reply with. Improv basically taught me to cut that shit out. I get so much more out of conversations when I understand what the other person is saying and where they are coming from. This is an absolutely necessary mindset in improv. You don\u0026rsquo;t know where your scene partner is going to take the scene, but the best laughs come from when you go with it.\nImprov taught me to be a team player. As the oldest child in my family, at times I felt like the prodigal son growing up. I had parents that celebrated my achievements which boosted my self esteem but at times made me feel like competing, achieving, and winning were part of the natural order of my life. At improv, there are no winners. There are no losers. It’s a true team experience where only collaboration and mutual understanding can make the audience – and the performers – laugh.\nFor more on improv and life skills, I would highly recommend this video.\nI met a bunch of other cool people Also enrolled in the improv class were people who weren’t afraid to try something new, enjoyed being silly, and who also wanted to meet other people. Improv required opening myself up and being vulnerable. Doing this repeatedly around the same group built a level of trust that is hard to come by in the “real world”. By the end of the class I felt like I could really connect with my classmates. We still keep in touch and a group is continuing on doing improv together.\nImprov was just plain old fun The most important thing for me was that improv was just plain old fun. I laughed. I played. I was happy.\nSometimes I can get caught up in the heaviness of life. I feel like I need to find my purpose in life, what I’m doing with it, who I’m doing it with. The answers to these questions can take a lifetime to become clear but I’m impatient… I want to know now! I want to know if I’m doing life right or if I’m fucking it all up!\nIn improv class, I can let go. I don’t need to worry about whether I\u0026rsquo;m winning or losing at life, making the right choices, spending my time in the right way. All I need to do is laugh. And it makes me think… maybe life is just supposed to be fucking fun.\nAnyway, improv rocks. Would recommend.\n","permalink":"https://danssorareramblings.github.io/posts/why-i-love-doing-improv-comedy/","summary":"A few months ago a friend of mine mentioned that he was taking an improv comedy class and was enjoying it more than he expected to.

Toronto is a team on their way up and their defense will steadily improve for the next couple of years.\nThe Past Shane’s involvement (or lack thereof) with the Sounders always confused me. This last season, he was mostly a “closer”. Schmeltzer would sub him in at around the 60 minute mark in games where Seattle was ahead and he would go in there and make hard tackles until the final whistle. Arreaga and Yeimar were preferred over him to start most of the time \u0026ndash; I felt that he was the victim of an overabundance of riches at CB for Seattle.\nThe Present Shane has just been signed by Toronto FC. Not only was he signed, he was the first signing that new head coach Bob Bradley made.\nTFC is an interesting story that only gets more interesting with every passing week. They had a terrible year last year. This offseason, it became clear very quickly that management wanted to turn things around in a big way. They hired former USMNT coach Bob Bradley and gave him the freedom to make major changes to the lineup, including the dismissal of two starting CBs in Gonzalez and Dunn. The pace of change in Toronto almost makes me think of them as an expansion team… they may have been around for a while, but I would imagine that their mindset is not too dissimilar from the mindset of Nashville SC, who over the past two years created a successful team out of thin air.\nWhat did Nashville SC do right? Well, the headline-grabber is Mukhtar. Nashville took to heart Bruce Arena’s advice that your DPs absolutely have to be your best players in the MLS. So too is Bradley. Whether Insigne and Belotti end up being the best players in MLS is up in the air, but it’s clear that this is Bradley\u0026rsquo;s intent.\nOk, what else did Nashville do right? Zimmerman. Nashville built a successful team from the back. I’m not sure how the timeline looks of how the team got put together but it’s clear that Zimmerman was on the radar of the Nashville coaching staff from the start, and he was one of the first signings the club made. It sounded like he wasn’t extremely stoked to leave LAFC but the Nashville coaching staff were over the moon to get him. He’s a team-oriented, tough CB who they thought could anchor the team during tough times.\nWho else is a team-oriented, tough CB who can anchor a new team during tough times? Shane O’Neill. O’Neill is the Zimmerman of Toronto FC. The only difference is that TFC is spending buckets of money on the Italians so they needed a cheaper option. O’Neill isn’t as skilled as Walker, but it’s close (he used to play forward), and he is certainly as tough and as team-oriented. Another difference between Zimmerman and O’Neill is O’Neill didn’t come off of a successful season in Seattle… if I were him I would be disappointed to play third fiddle to Yeimar and Arreaga. My guess is he has something to prove and this is the opportunity he’s been waiting for.\nThe Future Successful MLS start-ups are typically multi-year projects. Toronto will be no different.\nToronto has a good not great first year as Insigne and maybe Belotti adjust to MLS (which is absolutely a different kind of soccer than Europe). Shane puts up a bunch of double-doubles, some triple-doubles and triple-triples, but not a lot of clean sheets. The second year, however, TFC adds more depth to their lineup and figures it out on defense \u0026ndash; Shane’s numbers continue to improve, making him one of the most valuable defenders in the MLS. He’s there through 2024.\n","permalink":"https://danssorareramblings.github.io/posts/player-prospectus-shane-oneill/","summary":"I bought Shane O’Neill because I think he will start at center back for Toronto and play every minute of every game this upcoming season.

So I wrote a proposal to some friends about how a Sorare lending market would look:\nThere should be a lending market for sorare players. This would in general make the sorare card market more efficient and in specific:\nLower the bar to entry into sorare competitions (competitors can pay a\nfraction of lifetime ownership price to enter once) Allow card owners to generate revenue from assets that they are not using for competition A simple version of this would be relatively easy to create. The following would need to be tracked:\nA list of ongoing sell-side offers (managers looking to rent their player out). More specifically: The player The ideal loan length The ideal loan price. This could be fixed $, fixed eth, % of winnings, another card. A list of ongoing buy-side offers (managers looking for player(s) to complete their lineup). The same stuff would need to be tracked. Reputation for members of the platform. This could be in the form of verified completed loans and/or reviews from other members of the platform. As a stretch, perhaps there could be a mechanism where the receiver of the card could put up some collateral to raise the chances the loan would be respected. The main piece of feedback I received on this idea was that the more that Sorare lowers the bar to weekly competition entry, the more this game starts to look like sports gambling. And running a sports gambling game can be way more of a pain in the ass to manage than running a trading card game that hey, whaddaya know, has weekly prizes involved on the side. And I get that point.\nAdditionally, I think part of the magic of sorare is you get to act like a real life soccer team owner. This is a role that has traditionally been reserved for millionaires and billionaires who buy real soccer teams and real players. When I think about players that I should buy, I think about how they will fit in with the rest of my team. I think about their long-term utility, their mindset, where they are in their career, how they will grow and develop as a player and as a human being. And when they do grow and develop in that way, it feels good as an owner. And that’s a feeling that should be preserved through game mechanics, not thrown by the wayside in favor of greater asset utility.\nSo to sum up, lifetime player ownership is:\nEasier to manage from an operational perspective. It’s not gambling if it’s a trading card game. More emotionally involved and I think enhances the game experience. More expensive. On the other hand, weekly player ownership is:\nHarder to manage from an operational perspective as it’s closer to gambling. Less emotionally involved. If your player gets injured or whatever, no big deal, they\u0026rsquo;re not your player next week. Less expensive. Well, maybe there is a middle ground that can increase the utility of the cards somewhat, but also preserve the emotional involvement you get from long-term ownership. This middle-ground is the season-long loan.\nThe season-long loan would increase card utility and lower the bar to entry, to a lesser degree than weekly loans, but it still would.\nAnd:\nIt would make owning a sorare team even more like owning a real team, where season-long loans are a thing. It would create another mechanism to foster community amongst team owners. Unlike trades, which are transactional in nature, season-long loans would align the interests of two owners on the same card. What’s better than one person cheering for someone who scores a goal? Two people cheering for someone who scores a goal. So if you are on the Sorare team and you read this, make season-long loans a thing please!\n","permalink":"https://danssorareramblings.github.io/posts/feature-request-season-long-loans/","summary":"As I was searching for a card to fill out a sorare team, I was thinking to myself that there has to be a better way to do this.

As of now, there are gaps in the Nashville lineup… McCarty is getting older, Zimmerman’s cohorts in the back 3 could be stronger (looking at you, Miller), and Sapong is a good not great CF. But Nashville has $1M to work with from selling Johnston to Montreal, saved another $1M (and a DP spot) by letting go of Cadiz, and has DP Ake Loba waiting in the wings to fill in at CF. My bet is they splash on a DP at RB and sign a solid CDM to slowly slide in for McCarty \u0026ndash; spending this money wisely is easier with a solid core already established. They have their gaps but come February they will have filled them.\nNew England Revolution - The Revs return pretty much everyone minus Buchannon. I think we can expect to see pretty much what we saw last season \u0026ndash; Gil running the show with goals raining down from Bou and Buksa \u0026ndash; but with a slightly better defense now that Kessler + Farrell have a mentor in Gonzalez. With Buchannon gone some sting will be taken out of the offense as he did single-handedly win some games for them last year. Don\u0026rsquo;t sleep on MLS vet Ema Boateng to fill in for Buchannon where needed. The Revs will dominate the East again.\nVancouver Whitecaps - This is a surprise pick, but the Whitecaps were on fire down the stretch of last season, basically since Vanni Sartini became the head coach. I do not think this was a fluke. Aside from the fact that I love Sartini as a person, I think that he has done a great job with the team and it seems like they are genuinely happy under him. Brian White + Ryan Gauld will be one of the best CM/CF pairings in the league, and White will play for the national team by season’s end.\nSeattle Sounders - This team is loaded with talent and a perennial contender. Yeimar/Roldan/Morris is one of the strongest cores in the league. This team can suffer from too much of a good thing… it’s not always the case that their talent works well together. See their dismal exit from the playoffs last year. However, they will simply overpower most teams.\nSporting KC - Another perennial contender who have players who know how to win games in the MLS. Beric will be reborn after leaving the wreck that is the Chicago Fire and him along with Jonny Russell will be a top 5 pairing in the league. They need a CB to replace Ilie but my guess is that they will get one by February.\n","permalink":"https://danssorareramblings.github.io/posts/2022-mls-power-rankings-top-5/","summary":"Nashville SC - Nashville has the best center back in the league in Zimmerman and the 2nd best playmaker in Mukhtar.
