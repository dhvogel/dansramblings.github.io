Cool, how does it work? Go to http://beta.acyclequest.com</description>

      <title>Why I Love Doing Improv Comedy</title>

      <description>A few months ago a friend of mine mentioned that he was taking an improv comedy class and was enjoying it more than he expected to. Looking at my quarantine-stricken calendar, I figured “what the fuck, might as well try it too”. Internally, this represented a leap of faith for me as a prior version of myself would ridicule “theater kids”, “band kids”, “art kids”, or any other kind of kid brave enough to express themself in front of others.</description>

      <title>Player Prospectus: Shane O&#39;Neill</title>

      <description>I bought Shane O’Neill because I think he will start at center back for Toronto and play every minute of every game this upcoming season. Toronto is a team on their way up and their defense will steadily improve for the next couple of years.
The Past Shane’s involvement (or lack thereof) with the Sounders always confused me. This last season, he was mostly a “closer”. Schmeltzer would sub him in at around the 60 minute mark in games where Seattle was ahead and he would go in there and make hard tackles until the final whistle.</description>

      <description>As I was searching for a card to fill out a sorare team, I was thinking to myself that there has to be a better way to do this. So I wrote a proposal to some friends about how a Sorare lending market would look:
There should be a lending market for sorare players. This would in general make the sorare card market more efficient and in specific:
Lower the bar to entry into sorare competitions (competitors can pay a</description>

      <description>Nashville SC - Nashville has the best center back in the league in Zimmerman and the 2nd best playmaker in Mukhtar. As of now, there are gaps in the Nashville lineup… McCarty is getting older, Zimmerman’s cohorts in the back 3 could be stronger (looking at you, Miller), and Sapong is a good not great CF. But Nashville has $1M to work with from selling Johnston to Montreal, saved another $1M (and a DP spot) by letting go of Cadiz, and has DP Ake Loba waiting in the wings to fill in at CF.</description>
